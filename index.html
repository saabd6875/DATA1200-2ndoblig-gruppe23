    <h3>Potential Positive consequences</h3>
<p>
    <dd> Improved election fairness:

    </dd>
</p>
<p>
    <dd>Increased public confidence:
        It can boost people's trust in elections, as they'll have more faith that campaign information is honest and not manipulated by AI.
    </dd>
</p>

    <h3>Potential negative consequences</h3>
<p>
    <dd>Concerns about freedom of expression: 
        The law might limit freedom of expression since it bans AI-generated content, potentially stifling new ways of communicating in politics. 
    </dd>
</p>
<p> 
    <dd>Enforcement difficulties: 
        It would be problematic to enforce the ban, because of the difficulties surrounding the distinguishment of AI-generated content from human-generated content. This would lead to legal challenges.
    </dd>
</p>

<p> 
    <dd>Hurdle: 
        The law may hinder new, efficient campaign methods that AI can provide, limiting political innovation in the digital era.
