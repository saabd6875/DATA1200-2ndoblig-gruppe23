        <h3>Potential positive consequences</h3>
        <p>
            Implementing a ban on the use of AI in politics holds the potential
            to usher in a multitude of positive consequences.
            Foremost, it could significantly enhance the fairness of elections by
            curbing the rampant dissemination of AI-generated misinformation,
            thereby ensuring that all candidates are compelled to compete on a
            level playing field.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unchecked proliferation of AI-fueled falsehoods has been a growing
            concern, threatening the integrity of democratic processes.
            By restricting the use of AI in political campaigns, the veracity and
            credibility of electoral contests would receive a substantial boost,
            fostering an environment where citizens can make more informed choices.
        </p>
        <p>

            Furthermore, such a ban can contribute to rebuilding public trust in the transparency of the electoral
            system. Ensuring that political campaigns are conducted without AI manipulation would not only mitigate the
            potential for underhanded tactics but also promote open and honest communication between candidates and the
            electorate. In turn, this would strengthen the citizens' faith in their democratic institutions, thereby
            bolstering the overall health of a democracy. Ultimately, a ban on AI in politics could serve as a safeguard
            against the erosion of democratic values and the proliferation of misinformation, fostering a more robust
            and trustworthy electoral landscape.

        <h3>Potential negative consequences</h3>
        <p>
            The first consequence will be limiting the freedom of expression, since it bans AI-generated content,
            potentially stifling new ways of communicating in politics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The secound consequence is difficulties in enforcement, it would be problematic to enforce the ban, because
            of the difficulties surrounding the distinguisment of AI- genereted content from human-genereted content.
            This would lead to legal challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last consequence is that the companies can lose a lot from this new law, they may face reduced market
            opportunities and revenue if their services are banned in political campaigns.
